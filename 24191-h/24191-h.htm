<p>The translations contained in the present volume were undertaken since
the beginning of the great war when communication with Greece and
access to my sources of information were always difficult and at times
impossible. In hastening to present them to the English speaking
public before discussing them with the poet himself and my friends in
Athens, I am only yielding to the urgent requests of friends on both
sides of the Atlantic who have regarded my delay with justifiable
impatience. I am thoroughly conscious of the shortcomings that were
bound to result from the above difficulties and from the interruption
caused by my two years' service in the American army; and were it not
for the encouragement and loyal assistance of those interested in my
work it would have been impossible for me to bring it at all before
the public. My earnest effort has been to be as faithful to the poet
as possible, and for this reason I have not attempted to render rime,
a dangerous obstacle to a natural expression of the poet's thought and
diction. But I hope that the critics will judge my work as that of a
mere pioneer. I know there is value in the theme; and if this value is
made sufficiently evident to arouse the interest of poetry lovers in
the achievements of contemporary Greece I shall have reaped my best
reward.</p>

<p>I wish to express my thanks to Dr. Christos N. Lambrakis of Athens
for the information which he has always been willing to furnish me
regarding various dark points in the work translated; to Mrs. Eveleth
Winslow of Washington for many valuable suggestions and criticisms;
and above all to Professor Clifford H. Moore of Harvard University
for the interest he has shown in the work and the readiness with which
he has found time in the midst of his duties to take charge of my
manuscript in my absence and to assist in seeing it through the press.</p>

<h3>I<br />
THE STRUGGLE</h3>

<p>Kostes Palamas! A name I hated once with all the sincerity of a young
and blind enthusiast as the name of a traitor. This is no exaggeration.
I was a student in the third class of an Athenian Gymnasion in 1901,
when the Gospel Riots stained with blood the streets of Athens. The
cause of the riots was a translation of the New Testament into the
people's tongue by Alexandros Pallis, one of the great leaders of the
literary renaissance of Modern Greece. The translation appeared in
series in the daily newspaper <i>Akropolis</i>. The students of the
University, animated by the fiery speeches of one of their Professors,
George Mistriotes, the bulwark of the unreconcilable Purists, who would
model the modern language of Greece after the ancient, regarded this
translation as a treacherous profanation both of the sacred text and of
the national speech. The demotikists, branded under the name of [Greek:
Malliaroi] "the hairy ones," were thought even by serious people to be
national traitors, the creators of a mysterious propaganda seeking to
crush the aspirations of the Greek people by showing that their language
was not the ancient Greek language and that they were not the heirs of
Ancient Greece.</p>

<p>Three names among the "Hairy Ones" were the object of universal
detestation: John Psicharis, the well known Greek Professor in Paris,
the author of many works and of the first complete Grammar of the
people's idiom; Alexandros Pallis, the translator of the Iliad and of
the New Testament; and Kostes Palamas, secretary of the University of
Athens, the poet of this "anti-nationalistic" faction. Against them the
bitterest invectives were cast. The University students and, with them,
masses of people who joined without understanding the issue, paraded
uncontrollable through the streets of Athens, broke down the
establishment of the <i>Akropolis</i>, in which Pallis' vulgate version
appeared, and demanded in all earnestness of the Metropolitan that he
should renew the medieval measure of excommunication against all
followers of the "Hairy Ones."</p>

<p>Fortunately, the head of the Greek Church in Athens saved the
Institution which he represented from an indelible shame by resisting
the popular cries to the end. But the rioters became so violent that
arms had to be used against them, resulting in the death of eight
students and the wounding of about sixty others. This was utilized by
politicians opposing the government: fiery speeches denouncing the
measures adopted were heard in Parliament; the victims were eulogized as
great martyrs of a sacred cause; and popular feeling ran so high that
the Cabinet had to resign and the Metropolitan was forced to abdicate
and die an exile in a monastery on the Island of Salamis. It was then
that I first imbibed hatred against the "Hairy Ones" and Palamas.</p>

<p>About two years later, I had entered the University of Athens when
another riot was started by the students after another fiery speech
delivered by our puristic hero, Professor Mistriotes, against the
performance of Aeschylus' <i>Oresteia</i> at the Royal Theatre in a popular
translation made by Mr. Soteriades and considered too vulgar for
puristic ears. This time, too, the riot was quelled, but not until one
innocent passer-by had been killed. I am ashamed to confess that on that
occasion I was actually among the rioters. It was the day after the riot
that I first saw Palamas himself. He was standing before one of the side
entrances to the University building when my companion showed him to me
with a hateful sneer:</p>

<p>"Look at him!"</p>

<p>"Who is it?"</p>

<p>"The worst of them all, Palamas!"</p>

<p>I paused for a moment to have a full view of this notorious criminal.
Rather short and compact in frame, he stood with eyes directed towards
the sunlight streaming on the marble covered ground of the yard. He held
a cane with both his hands and seemed to be thinking. Once or twice he
glanced at the wall as if he were reading something, but again he turned
towards the sunlight with an expression of sorrow on his face. There was
nothing conspicuous about him, nothing aggressive. His rather pale face,
furrowed brow, and meditative attitude were marks of a quiet, retiring,
modest man. Do traitors then look so human? From the end of the
colonnade, I watched him carefully until he turned away and entered the
building. Then I followed him and walked up to the same entrance; on the
wall, an inscription was scratched in heavy pencil strokes:</p>
<blockquote class="quotation">
    <p>"Down with Palamas! the bought one! the traitor!"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At last my humanity was aroused, and the first rays of sympathy began to
dispel my hatred. That remorseless inscription could not be true of this
man, I thought, and I hurried to the library to read some of his work
for the first time that I might form an opinion about him myself.
Unfortunately, the verses on which I happened to come were too deep for
my intellect, and I had not the patience to read them twice. I was so
absolutely sure of the power of my mind that I ascribed my lack of
understanding to the poet. Then his poems were so different from the
easy, rhythmic, oratorical verses on which I had been brought up. In
Palamas, I missed those pleasant trivialities which attract a boy's mind
in poetry. One thing, however, was clear to me even then. Dark and
unintelligible though his poems appeared, they were certainly full of a
deep, passionate feeling, a feeling that haunted my thoughts long after
I had closed his book in despair. From that day, I condescended to think
of him as of a sincere follower of a wrong cause, as of a sheep that had
been led astray.</p>

<p>Years went by. I was no more in Greece. I had come to another country,
where a new language, a new history, a new literature opened before me.
Here, at last, I began to assume a reasonable attitude towards the
question of the language of my old country, and here first I could read
Palamas with understanding. Gradually, his greatness began to dawn on
me, and, finally, my admiration for him had grown so much that when on
April, 1914, I reached Greece as a travelling fellow from Harvard
University, I had decided to concentrate my studies during the five
months I was planning to spend there upon him and his work. With his
work, I did spend many long and pleasant hours. But him I visited only
once. The man from whom I had once shrunk as from a monster of evil, now
I shunned for fear I had not yet learned to admire in accordance with
his greatness. Owing to the urgent demand of an old classmate, Dr. Ch.
N. Lambrakis, who knew the poet, I went to see him one April afternoon
in his office at the University with my friend and fellow traveller, Mr.
Francis P. Farquhar. Mr. Palamas was sitting at his official desk; but
as soon as we entered he rose to receive us and then sat modestly in the
corner of a sofa. He had changed very little in appearance since the
time of the riots, and the more I looked at him the more I recognized
the very same image which I had kept in my mind from the first encounter
I had with him in the University colonnade ten years before. Perhaps,
the furrows of his brow had now become deeper; the white hairs, more
numerous. His eyes were still the same fiery eyes penetrating wherever
they lit beneath the surface of things and often turning away from the
present into the world of thought. His hands moved quietly; his voice
was clear and sonant; his words were few and polite. Unassuming in his
manner, he seemed more eager to receive knowledge than to talk about
himself and his work. He asked us questions about America and its
literary life: Is Poe read and appreciated? Is Walt Whitman still
popular? He admired them both; he had a great craving for the new; and
to read things about America fascinated him. When we rose to leave, we
realized that we had been doing the talking, but on both of us the
personality of the man, reserved and unobstrusive though he was, had
made a deep and lasting impression.</p>

<p>This was the only visit I had with him. But I saw him more than once
walk in the streets of Athens and among the plane trees of Zappeion by
the banks of Ilissus, or sitting alone at a table of some unfrequented
coffeehouse, always far from the crowd. It was only after I had returned
to America that I wrote to him for permission to translate some of his
works. The answer came laden with the same modesty which is so prominent
a characteristic of the man. He is afraid I am exaggerating the value of
his work, and he calls himself a mere laborer of the verse. Certainly he
has been a faithful laborer for a cause which a generation ago seemed
hopeless. But through his faith and power, he has snatched the crown of
victory from the hands of Time, and he may now be acclaimed as a new
World-Poet.</p>

<p>"The poetic work of Kostes Palamas," says Eugène Clement, a French
critic, in a recent article on the poet, "presents itself today with an
imposing greatness. Without speaking about his early collections, in
which already a talent of singular power is revealed, we may say that
the four or five volumes of verse, which he has published during the
last ten years raise him beyond comparison not only above all poets of
Modern Greece but above all poets of contemporary Europe. Though he is
not the most famous&mdash;owing to his overshadowing modesty and to the
language he writes, which is little read beyond the borders of
Hellenism&mdash;<i>he is incontestably the greatest</i>. The breadth of his views
on the world and on humanity, on the history and soul of his race, in
short, on all problems that agitate modern thought, places him in the
first rank among those who have had the gift to clothe the philosophic
idea in the sumptuous mantle of poetry. On the other hand, the vigor and
richness of his imagination, the penetrating warmth of his feeling, the
exquisite perfection of his art, and his gifted style manifest in him a
poetic temperament of an exceptional fulness that was bound to give
birth to great masterpieces."</p>


<h3>II<br />
LIFE INFLUENCES</h3>

<h4><a id="Patras">Patras</a></h4>

<p>Kostes Palamas was born in Patras sixty years ago. Patras is one of the
most ancient towns in Greece, known even in mythical times as Aroe, the
seat of King Eumelus, "rich in flocks." It became especially prominent
after the reign of Augustus as a centre of commerce and industry. Its
factories of silk were renowned in Byzantine times, and its commanding
position attracted the Crusaders and the Venetians as a military base
for the conquest of the Peloponnesus. The citadel walls that crown the
hill, on the slopes of which the modern city descends amphitheatrically
into the sea, are remnants of Venetian fortifications. In the history of
Modern Greece, it is a hallowed spot; for it was here that on April 4,
1821, the standard of the War of Liberation was first raised before a
band of warriors kneeling before the altar of Hagia Laura, while
Germanos, the archbishop of the city, prayed for the success of their
arms. The view which the city commands over the sapphire spaces of the
Corinthian Gulf and the purple shadows of the mountains rising from its
waters in all directions are superb, and the sunsets, that evening after
evening revel in colors there, are among the most magnificent in Greece.
A beauty worthy of life dwells over the vine-clad hills, while the
mountain kings that rise about are hoary with age and fame. The eye
wanders from the purple-laden cliffs of Kylene to the opal mantles of
the sea and from the peaks of Parnassus to the lofty range of Kiona.
This is the background of one of Palamas' "Hundred Voices," a collection
of short lyrics in the volume entitled <i>Life Immovable</i>:</p>
<blockquote class="quotation">
    <p>Far glimmered the sea, and the harvest darkened the threshing
            floors;<br />
    I cared not for the harvest and looked not on the threshing floors;<br />
    For I stood on the end of the sea, and thee I beheld from afar,<br />
    O white, ethereal Liakoura, waiting that from thy midst<br />
    Parnassus, the ancient, shine forth and the Nine Fair Sisters of
            Song.<br />
    Yet, what if the fate of Parnassus is changed? What if the Nine Fair
            Sisters are gone?<br />
    Thou standest still, O Liakoura, young and for ever one,<br />
    O thou Muse of a future Rhythm and a Beauty still to be born.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To his birth place, the poet dedicates one of his collection of sonnets
entitled "Fatherlands" and contained in the same volume. It is the first
of the series:</p>
<blockquote class="quotation">
    <p>Where with its many ships the harbor moans,<br />
    The land spreads beaten by the billows wild,<br />
    Remembering not even as a dream<br />
    Her ancient silkworks, carriers of wealth.</p>

    <p>The vineyards, filled with fruit, now make her rich;<br />
    And on her brow, an aged crown she wears,<br />
    A castle that the strangers, Franks or Turks,<br />
    Thirst for, since Venice founded it with might.</p>

    <p>O'er her a mountain stands, a sleepless watch;<br />
    And white like dawn, Parnassus shimmers far<br />
    Aloft with midland Zygos at his side.</p>

    <p>Here I first opened to the day mine eyes;<br />
    And here my memory weaves a dream dream-born,<br />
    An image faint, half-vanished, fair&mdash;a mother.</p>

<h4><a id="Missolonghi">Missolonghi</a></h4>

<p>But in Patras, the child did not stay long. His early home seems to have
been broken up by the death of his mother, and we find him next in
Missolonghi, another glorious spot in the history of Modern Greece. It
does not pride itself on its antiquity. It developed late in the Middle
Ages from a fishing hamlet colonized by people who were attracted by the
abundance of fish in the lagoon separating the town from the sea. This
lagoon lies across the Corinthian Gulf to the northwest of Patras,
hardly an hour's sail from it. Its shallow waters, which can be
traversed only by small flat-bottomed dories propelled with poles,
extend between the mouths of the Phidaris and the Acheloös, and are
studded with small islets just emerging above the face of the lagoon and
covered with rushes. Two of these islets, Vassiladi and Kleisova,
attained great fame by the heroic resistance of their garrisons against
the forces of Kioutachi and Imbrahim, Pashas in the War of Liberation.
The town itself is a shrine of patriotism for modern Greeks. For from
1822 to 1826, with its humble walls hardly stronger than fences, it
sustained the attacks of very superior forces, and its ground was
hallowed by the blood of many national heroes. Just outside its walls
lies the "Heroes' Garden" or "Heroön," where under the shadows of
eucalyptus and cypress trees, Marcos Bozzaris, Mavromichalis, the
philhellene General Coreman, and Lord Byron's heart are buried. It was
during the second siege that Byron died here in the midst of his noble
efforts for the freedom of Greece. The fall of the city brought about by
famine is the most glorious defeat in the history of the Greek
Revolution. The garrison of three thousand soldiers with six thousand
unarmed persons including women and children, unwilling to surrender,
attempted to break through the Turkish lines. But only one-sixth managed
to escape. The rest were driven back and mercilessly cut down by their
pursuers. Many took refuge in the powder magazines of the city and
waited until the Turks drew up in great numbers; then they set fire to
the powder and blew up friends and foes alike. The second sonnet of
Palamas' "Fatherlands" is devoted to this lagoon city:</p>
<blockquote class="quotation">
    <p>Upon the lake, the island-studded, where<br />
    The breeze of May, grown strong with sea-brine, stirs<br />
    The seashore strewn with seaweed far away,<br />
    The Fates cast me a little child thrice orphan.</p>

    <p>'Tis there the northwind battles mightily<br />
    Upon the southwind; and the high tide on<br />
    The low; and far into the main's abyss<br />
    The dazzling coral of the sun is sinking.</p>

    <p>There stands Varassova, the triple-headed;<br />
    And from her heights, a lady from her tower,<br />
    The moon bends o'er the waters lying still.</p>

    <p>But innocent peace, the peace that is a child's,<br />
    Not even there I knew; but only sorrow<br />
    And, what is now a fire&mdash;the spirit's spark.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here then, "the spirit's spark" was first kindled, and here, in the city
of his ancestors, the poet was born. The swampy meadows overgrown with
rushes and surrounded with violet mountains, the city with its narrow
crooked streets and low-roofed houses, the lagoon with its still shallow
waters and modest islets, the life of townsmen and peasants with their
humbles occupations, passions, and legends, above all, the picturesque
distinctness of this somewhat isolated place, secluded, as it seems, in
an atmosphere laden with national lore&mdash;these were the incentives which
stirred Palamas in his quest of song. They have stamped their image on
all his work, but their most distinct reflection is found in <i>The
Lagoon's Regrets</i>, which is filled with memories of the poet's early
life in a world he always remembers with affection:</p>
<blockquote class="quotation">
    <p>Imagination flies to hells and stars,<br />
    A witch beguiling, an enchantress strange;<br />
    But ours the Heart remains and binds both life<br />
    And love with the native soil, nor seems to die.</p>

    <p>Peaks, depths, I sought Eurydice of old:<br />
    "What longing moans within me now, new-born?<br />
    Would that I were a fisherman at work,<br />
    Waking thy sleeping waters with my oar,<br />
    O Missolonghi!"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Humble but natural in feeling is the appeal to a friend of his childhood
days:</p>
<blockquote class="quotation">
    <p>The peasant's huts in Midfield<br />
    For us, old friend, are waiting:<br />
    Come as of old to eat<br />
    The fresh-made cheese, and taste<br />
    The hard-made loaf of cornbread.</p>

    <p>Come, and drink the milk drawn pure;<br />
    And filled with dew and gladness,<br />
    Stir up the hunger of the youth<br />
    Beside you, buxom lasses.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, too, he sings of the "crystal salt that is drawn snow-white from
the lake"; of the rain "that always weeps" and of the conquering tides.
Here he listens to the whispers of the waves while they murmur with each
other with restrained pride; and here over Byron's grave he dreams of
the great poet of Greece, who will come to ride on Byron's winged horse.
The poems of this collection are short but exquisitely wrought in verse
and language, full of life and of feeling. They are especially marked
with Palamas' attachment to the little and humble, which he loves to
raise into music and rhythm, and for which he always has sympathy and
even admiration.</p>


<h4>Athens, the Violet-Crowned</h4>

<p>Missolonghi nurtured the poet in his youth and led him to the threshold
of manhood. But when he had graduated from the provincial "gymnasion,"
he naturally came to Athens in order to complete his education in the
University of that city, the only University in Greece. This brought him
to the place which was destined to develop his greatness to its zenith.
The quiet, retired, and humble life of the Lagoon with its air filled
with legend was suddenly exchanged for the shining rocks of Attica and
its great city, flooded with dazzling light and roofed with a sky that
keeps its azure even in the midst of night. Life here is full, restless,
and tumultuous as in the days of Athens of old. The violet shadows of
the mountains enclosing the silver olive groves of the white plain are
still the makers of the violet crown of Athens.</p>

<p>The poet in one of his "Hundred Voices" pictures a clear Attic afternoon
in February:</p>
<blockquote class="quotation">
    <p>Even in the winter's heart, the almonds are ablossom!<br />
    And lo, the angry month is gay with sunshine laughter,<br />
    While to this beauty round about a crown you weave,<br />
    O naked rocks and painted mountain slopes of Athens.</p>

    <p>Even the snow on Parnes seems like fields in bloom;<br />
    A timid greenish glow caresses like a dream<br />
    The Heights of Corydallus; white Pentele smiles upon<br />
    The Sacred Rock of Pallas; and old Hymettus stoops<br />
    To listen to the love-song of Phaleron's sea.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is its scanty vegetation that makes the southwestern region of Attica
look like a mountain lake of light. The nakedness of the mountain ranges
and the whiteness of the plains are vaulted over by a brilliant sky and
surrounded by a sea of a splendid sapphire glow. Even the olive trees,
which still grace the fields about Athens are bunches of silver rather
than of green. In "The Satyr, or the Naked Song," taken from the volume
of <i>Town and Wilderness</i> we may detect the very spirit which, springing
from the same soil thousands of years ago, created the song which
gradually rose from primitive sensuousness to the heights of the Greek
Tragedy:</p>

<h4>Athens, the Centre of Greece</h4>

<p>So much of the natural atmosphere of Athens and Attica. But the
Athenians themselves, their thoughts, life, and dreams have not proved
less important nor less effective for the poet's growth. The spiritual
and intellectual currents moving the Greek nation of today start from
this city. Here politics, poetry, and philosophy are still discussed in
the old way at the various shops, the coffee houses, and under the plane
trees by the banks of Ilissus. The "boulé" is the centre of the
political activity of the state. The University with its democratic
faculty and still more democratic student body is certainly a "flaming"
hearth of culture. Only, its flames are sometimes so ventilated by
current events and political developments that the students often assume
the functions of the old Athenian Assembly. In the riotous expression of
their temporary feelings, the students are not very different from the
ancient demesmen. In my days, at least, the most frequent greeting
among students was "How is politics today?", with the word "politics"
used in its ancient meaning. Any question of general interest might
easily be regarded as a national issue to be treated on a political
basis. Thus it happened that when the question of language was brought
to the foreground by Pallis' vernacular translation of the New
Testament, the students took up arms rather than argument.</p>

<p>Into this world, the poet came to finish his education. In one of his
critical essays (<i>Grammata</i>, vol. i), he tells us of the literary
atmosphere prevailing in Athens at that time, about 1879. That year,
Valaorites, the second great poet of the people's language, died, and
his death renewed with vigor the controversy that had continued even
after the death of Solomos, the earliest great poet of Modern Greece.
The passing away of Valaorites left Rangabes, the relentless purist, the
monarch of the literary world. He was considered as the master whom
every one should aspire to imitate. His language, ultra-puristic, had
travelled leagues away from the people without approaching at all the
splendor of the ancient speech. But the purists drew great delight from
reading his works and clapped their hands with satisfaction on seeing
how near Plato and Aeschylus they had managed to come.</p>

<p>Young and susceptible to the popular currents of the literary world,
Palamas, too, worshipped the established idol, and offered his
frankincense in verses modelled after Rangabean conceptions. In the same
essay to which I have just referred, he tells us of the life he led with
another young friend, likewise a literary aspirant, during the years of
his attendance at the University. The two lived and worked together.
They wrote poems in the puristic language and compared their works in
stimulating friendliness. But soon they realized the truth that if
poetry is to be eternal, it must express the individual through the
voice of the world to which the individual belongs and through the
language which the people speak.</p>

<p>This truth took deep roots in the mind of Palamas. His conviction grew
into a religion permeated with the warmth, earnestness, and devotion
that martyrs only have shown to their cause. Believing that purism was
nothing but a blind attempt to drown the living traditions of the people
and to conceal its nature under a specious mantle of shallow
gorgeousness, he has given his talent and his heart to save his nation
from such a calamity. In this great struggle, he has suffered not a
little. When the popular fury rose against his cause, and he was
blackened as a traitor and a renegade, he wrote in words illustrating
his inner agony:</p>
<blockquote class="quotation">
    <p>I labored long to create the statue for the Temple<br />
    Of stone that I had found,<br />
    To set it up in nakedness, and then to pass;<br />
    To pass but not to die.</p>

    <p>And I created it. But narrow men who bow<br />
    To worship shapeless wooden images, ill clad,<br />
    With hostile glances and with shudderings of fear,<br />
    Looked down upon us, work and worker, angrily.</p>

    <p>My statue in the rubbish thrown! And I, an exile!<br />
    To foreign lands I led my restless wanderings;<br />
    But ere I left, a sacrifice unheard I offered:<br />
    I dug a pit, and in the pit I laid my statue.</p>

    <p>And then I whispered: "Here, lie low unseen and live<br />
    With things deep-rooted and among the ancient ruins<br />
    Until thine hour comes. Immortal flower thou art!<br />
    A Temple waits to clothe thy nakedness divine!"</p>

    <p>And with a mouth thrice-wide, and with the voice of prophets,<br />
    The pit spoke: "Temple, none! Nor pedestal! Nor light!<br />
    In vain! For nowhere is thy flower fit, O maker!<br />
    Better for ever lost in these unlighted depths.</p>

    <p>"Its hour may never come! And if it come, and if<br />
    Thy work be raised, the Temple will be radiant<br />
    With a great host of statues, statues of no blemish,<br />
    And works of thrice-great makers unapproachable.</p>

    <p>"To-day was soon for thee; to-morrow will be late.<br />
    Thy dream is vain; the dawn thou longest will not dawn;<br />
    Thus, burning for eternities thou mayest not reach,<br />
    Remain, Cloud-Hunter and Praxiteles of shadows!</p>

    <p>"To-morrow and to-day for thee are snares and seas.<br />
    All are but traps for drowning thee and visions false.<br />
    Longer than thy glory is the violet's in thy garden!<br />
    And thou shalt pass away; hear this, and thou shalt die!"</p>

    <p>And then I answered: "Let me pass away and die!<br />
    Creator am I, too, with all my heart and mind;<br />
    Let pits devour my work. Of all eternal things,<br />
    My restless wandering may have the greatest worth."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The same idea, though expressed in a more familiar figure, is found in
another poem published among <i>The Lagoon's Regrets</i>.</p>
<blockquote class="quotation">
    <h5>The Guitar</h5>

    <p>In the old attic of the humble house,<br />
    The guitar hangs in cobwebs wrapped:<br />
    Softly, oh, softly touch her! Listen!<br />
    You have awaked the sleeping one!</p>

    <p>She is awake, and with her waking,<br />
    Something like distant humming bees<br />
    Creeps far away and weeps about her;<br />
    Something that lives while ruins choke it.</p>

    <p>Something like moans, like humming bees,<br />
    Thy sickened children, old guitar,<br />
    Thy words and airs. What evil pest,<br />
    What blight is eating thine old age!</p>

    <p>In the old attic of the humble house,<br />
    Thou hast awaked; but who will tend thee?<br />
    O Mother, wilderness about thee!<br />
    Thy children, withering; and something,<br />
    Like humming bees, sounds far away!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A distinct note of pessimism is found in the lines of both these poems.
In the latter, it becomes a helpless cry of anguish. But despair seems
to cure the poet rather than drown his faith in hopelessness. As a
critic, he encourages every initiate of the cause. As a "soldier of the
verse," he himself fights his battles of song in every field. In short
story, in drama, in epic poetry, and above all in lyrics, he creates
work after work. From the <i>Songs of my Country</i>, the <i>Hymn to Athena</i>,
the <i>Eyes of my Soul</i> and the <i>Iambs and Anapaests</i>, he rises gradually
and steadily to the tragic drama of the <i>Thrice Noble-One</i>, to the epic
of <i>The King's Flute</i>, and to the splendid lyrics of <i>Life Immovable</i>
and <i>The Twelve Words of the Gypsy</i> which are his masterpieces.</p>

<p>Nor does he always meet adversity with songs of resignation. At times,
he faces indignantly the hostile world with a satire as stinging as that
of Juvenal. He dares attack with Byronic boldness every idol that his
enemies worship. Often he strikes at the whole people with Archilochean
bitterness and parries blow for blow like Hipponax. At times, he even
seems to approach the rancor of Swift. But then he immediately throws
away his whip and transcends his satire with a loftier thought, a
soothing moral, a note of lyricism, and above all with an unshaken faith
in the new day for which he works. The eighth and ninth poems of the
first book of his "Satires" are good illustrations of this side of his
work:</p>
<blockquote class="quotation">
    <h6>8</h6>

    <p>The lazy drones! The frogs! The locusts!<br />
    Big men! Politicians! Men who draw<br />

    Unworthily, thy name is set<br />
    By each as target for blind blows;</p>

    Up toward the high bell-tower above,<br />
    And climbest: Spaces spread about thee,</p>

    <p>And at thy feet, a world of scorners.<br />
    Though thou rainest not the godsent manna,<br />
    A great Life-giver still, thou tollest</p>

    <p>They fit you, redeemers or redeemed!<br />
    Bind with these chains your golden youth;<br />
    I bring you cares and sacrifices.</p>

    Modesty, Knowledge, Discipline!<br />
    To one command obey last, first,</p>

    <p>The world's great laws, and men, and nations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of his "Hundred Voices" has something of this satiric note. It is a
blow against a worthless pretender of the art of verse, who courts
popularity with strains not worthy of the sacred Muse. Palamas, acting
with greater wisdom than Pope, does not give the name of this unknown
pretender:</p>
<blockquote class="quotation">
    <p>Bad? Would that thou wert bad; but something worse thou art:<br />
    Thou stretchedst an unworthy hand to the sacred lyre,<br />
    And the untaught mob took thy reeling in the dust<br />
    For the true song of golden wings; and thou didst take<br />
    Thy seat close by the poet's side so thoughtlessly,<br />
    And none dared rise and come to drag thee thence away.<br />
    And see, instead of scorning thee, the just was angry;<br />
    Yet, even his verse's arrow is for thee a glory!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5>The Grave</h5>

<p>In tracing the great life influences of our poet, we must not pass over
the loss of his third child, "the child without a peer," as he says
in one of his poems addressed to his wife, "who changed the worldly
air about us into divine nectar, a worthy offering to the spotless-white
light of Olympus." To this loss, the poet has never reconciled himself.
The sorrow finds expression in direct or covert strains in every work he
has written. But its lasting monument was created soon after the child's
death. A collection of poems, entitled <i>The Grave</i>, entirely devoted
to his memory, is overflowing with an unique intensity of feeling.
The poems are composed in short quatrains of a slowly moving rhythm
restrained by frequent pauses and occasional metrical irregularities,
and thus they reflect with faithfulness the paternal agony with which
they are filled. They belong to the earlier works of the poet, but they
disclose great lyric power and are the first deep notes of the poet's
genius. A few lines from the dedication follow:</p>
<blockquote class="quotation">
    <p>Neither with iron,<br />
    Nor with gold,<br />
    Nor with the colors<br />
    That the painters scatter,</p>

    <p>Nor with marble<br />
    Carved with art,<br />
    Your little house I built<br />
    For you to dwell for ever;</p>

    <p>With spirit charms alone<br />
    I raised it in a land<br />
    That knows no matter nor<br />
    The withering touch of Time.</p>

    <p>With all my tears,<br />
    With all my blood,<br />
    I founded it<br />
    And built its vault....</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In another poem, in similar strains, he paints the ominous tranquility
with which the child's birth and parting were attended:</p>
<blockquote class="quotation">
    <p>Tranquilly, silently,<br />
    Thirsting for our kisses,<br />
    Unknown you glided<br />
    Into our bosom;</p>

    <p>Even the heavy winter<br />
    Suddenly smiled<br />
    Tranquilly, silently,<br />
    But to receive you;</p>

    <p>Tranquilly, silently,<br />
    The breeze caressed you,<br />
    O Sunlight of Night<br />
    And Dream of the Day;</p>

    <p>Tranquilly, silently,<br />
    Our home was gladdened<br />
    With sweetness of amber<br />
    With your grace magnetic;</p>

    <p>Tranquilly, silently,<br />
    Our home beheld you,<br />
    Beauty of the morning star,<br />

<p>In another poem reminiscent of Tibullean tenderness, the corners of the

    "Here, often he sat listening<br />

<h4>The World Beyond Greece</h4>

<p>Greece seems to encompass the physical world with which Palamas has come
in contact. He does not seem to have travelled beyond its borders, and
even within them, he has moved little about. With him scenery must grow
with age before it speaks to his heart. Fleeting impressions are of
little value, and the appearance of things without the forces of
tradition and experience behind it does not attract him:</p>
<blockquote class="quotation">
    <p>Others, who wander far in distant lands may seek<br />
    On Alpine Mountains high the magic Edelweis;<br />
    I am an Element Immovable; each year,<br />
    April delights me in my garden, and the May<br />
    In my own village.<br />
    O lakes and fiords, O palaces of France and shrines<br />
    And harbors, Northern Lights and tropic flowers and forests,<br />
    O wonders of art, and beauties of the world unthought,&mdash;<br />
    A little Island here I love that always lies before me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We must not think, however, that the spirit of Palamas rests within the
narrow confines of his native land. On the contrary, it knows no chains
and travels freely about the earth. He is a faithful servant of
"Melete," the Muse of contemplative study, a service which is very
seldom liked by Modern Greeks. In his preface to his collection of
critical essays entitled <i>Grammata</i> he rebukes his fellow countrymen for
this: "On an old attic vase," he says, "stand the three original Muses,
the ones that were first worshipped, even before the Nine, who are now
world-known: Mneme, Melete, Aoide&mdash;Memory, Study, Song. With the first
and last, we have cultivated our acquaintance; and never must we show
any contempt for the fruit of our love for them. Only with the middle
one, we are not on good terms. She seems to be somewhat inaccessible,
and she does not fill our eyes enough to attract us. We have always
looked, and now still we look, for what is easiest or handiest. Is that,
I wonder, a fault of our race or of our age? And is the French
philosopher Fouillée somewhat right when in his book on the <i>Psychology
of Races</i> he counts among our defects our aversion to great and above
all endless labors?" That Palamas is not subject to this fault, one has
only to glance at his works to be convinced. There is hardly an
important force in the world's thought and expression whether past or
present, to which Palamas is a stranger. The literatures of Europe,
America, or Asia are an open book for him. The pulses of the world's
artists, the intellectual battles of the philosophers, the fears and
hopes of the social unrest, the religious emancipation of our day, the
far reaching conflict of individual and state, in short, all events of
importance in the social, political, spiritual, literary, and artistic
life are familiar sources of inspiration for him. With all, he shows the
lofty spirit of a worshipper of greatness and depth wherever he finds
them. Tolstoi or Aeschylus, Goethe or Dante, Ibsen or Poe, Swinburne or
Walt Whitman, Leopardi or Rabelais, Hugo or Carlyle, Serbian Folk Lore
or the Bible, Hindu legends or Italian songs, Antiquity or Middle Ages,
Renaissance or Modernity, any nation or any lore are objects worthy of
study and stores of wisdom for him. Indeed, very few living poets could
be compared with him in scholarship and learning.</p>

<p>Nor does he lift his voice only for individual or national throbbings.
He sings of the great and noble whenever he sees it. One of his best
lyric creations is a song of praise to the valor of the champions of
Transvaal's freedom, his "Hymn to the Valiant," the first of the
collection entitled "From the Hymns and Wraths," a paean that has been
most highly lauded by Professor D.C. Hesseling of the University of
Leyden (<i>Nederlandsche Spectator</i>, March, 1901). Here is a fragment of
it, the words which the Muse addresses to the poet:</p>
<blockquote class="quotation">
    <p>... Awake! Thou art not maker of statues!<br />
    Awake! For songs thou singest!<br />
    And song is not for ever<br />
    The heart's lament<br />
    To fading leaves of autumn,<br />
    Nor the secret speech thou speakest,<br />
    A Soul of Dream, to the shadows of Night.</p>

    <p>For suddenly there is a clash and groaning!<br />
    The joy of birds sea-beaten,<br />
    In storms of Elements<br />
    And storms of Nations!<br />
    Song is, too,<br />
    The Marathonian Triumpher!<br />
    Over the ashes of Sodoma,<br />
    It is blown by the mouth of wrath!</p>

    <p>Something great and something beautiful,<br />
    Something from far away,<br />
    Travelling Glory brings thee<br />
    On her sky-wandering pinions.</p>

    <p>Glory has come! On her wings and on her feet,<br />
    Signs of her wanderings are shown,<br />
    Dust gold-loaded and distant;<br />
    And she brings aloes blossoming, first-seen,<br />
    From the land that feeds the Kaffir's flocks.</p>

    <p>In your aged summers,<br />
    A new-born spring has spread!<br />
    From North to South,<br />
    The Atlantic Dragon groans a groan first-heard;<br />
    To the African lakes and forests,<br />
    His groan has spread and echoed;<br />
    From the Red Sea, a Lamia's palace,<br />
    To the foam-shaped breast of the White Sea,<br />
    A Nereid's realm.</p>

    <p>Thinly the plants were growing<br />
    On the bosom of the ancient Motherland;<br />
    Winds carried away the seed<br />
    And brought it to the Libyan fields<br />
    And scattered it into deep ravines<br />
    And on the lofty mountain lawns.</p>

    <p>A new blood filled the herbs,<br />
    And even the strong-stemmed plants<br />
    Waxed stronger.<br />
    Men war-glad are risen!<br />
    And the waterfalls roar<br />
    In the mountain's heart;<br />
    Men war-glad are risen<br />
    Like diamonds rare to behold<br />
    That the earth begets!</p>

    <p>You know them, heights, winds, horizons,<br />
    High tides and murmurings of restless waters,<br />
    Golden fountains, that shall become<br />
    Their crowns!<br />
    And you, O gold-built mountain passes,<br />
    Castles fit for them, you know them;<br />
    Their fame, thou heraldest with pride<br />
    From thy verdant distant country<br />
    To Europe Imperial,<br />
    O Africa, O slave unknown!</p>

    <p>And first of all thou knowest,<br />
    O heartless tamer of continents and races,<br />
    Rider of Ocean's Bucephaluses,<br />
    Thou knowest the worth of the few,<br />
    Who dare live free ...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Within the limits of a general introduction it would be difficult to
enter every nook and corner of the poet's world. We must even pass over
some of the most potent influences of his life. The national dreams of
the Modern Greeks have a splendid dwelling in the thought of Palamas,
who follows with restlessness his people's woes and exults in their
joys. A group of poems dedicated to the "Land that Rose in Arms" and
published in the last volume of the poet's work, the <i>Town and
Wilderness</i>, form his noblest patriotic expression. The present
world-conflict has naturally stirred him to new compositions, of which
his "Europe" is preëminently noteworthy as illustrating faithfully the
various aspects of the poet's genius. This poem appeared first in the
<i>Noumas</i>, an Athenian periodical, and was then published in the last
volume of the poet's works, the <i>Altars</i>.<a href="#footnote_02" class="footnote" id="footnote_ref_02">[2]</a></p>

    <p>I am the faithful friend of song; therefore,<br />
    I tremble not like child before a blackman;<br />
    Midst blood and flames and lashings horrible,<br />
    I bring thee, Love!</p>

    <p>Thy footprints mark a shining trail of lights<br />
    New-risen, guiding with their gleams my steps;<br />
    The restless gambol of thy fire, Dawn's smile<br />
    Upon my night.</p>

    <p>Thine eyes, O Fountainhead of Beauty's stream,<br />
    Mirror within them all things beautiful:<br />
    And lo, the eagles of the Czars, on wings<br />
    Sky-roaming, sail.</p>

    <p>The war, when thine eyes look on it, becomes<br />
    Under the magic of thy glance pure wine<br />
    Of holiness. The German is the wonder<br />
    Of deed and thought;</p>

    <p>Where Tolstoi lived, all things are justly blessed;<br />
    Where Goethe dwelt all things are light and wisdom;<br />
    And yet my heart's pure love flows now for thee,<br />
    For thee, O France!</p>

    <p>Though first I sucked my god-sprung mother's milk,<br />
    Still thou wert later manna unto me,<br />
    Desert-born, joy of mine and guide and teacher,<br />
    My second mother.</p>

    <p>On thy world-trodden earth, I have not stood;<br />
    Nor didst thou bathe me, Seine, in thy cold waters;<br />
    Yet is thy vision light unto my song,<br />
    O second mother!</p>

    <p>O Celtic oak-trees and Galatian-born<br />
    White lilies in lyric Paris blossoming,<br />
    With Hugo and with thee, O Lamartine,<br />
    Revels and wings!</p>

    <p>Dante and Nietzsche, Ibsen, Shakespeare, all,<br />
    Poured wine for me with their thrice-holy hands<br />
    Into thy gleaming cup of gold and bade<br />

    <p>A child: And thou didst flash before me first,<br />
    Tearing the maps of dazzled Europe's lands<br />
    With the world's Mirabeaus and with the world's<br />
    Napoleons.</p>

    <p>Thou art not for the gnawing worm of graves.<br />
    Thy gods still live with thee, Hypatia!<br />
    Glory and Victory may dwell with thee,<br />
    Democracy!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the number of the life influences which we have scantily traced in
Palamas' work we may conclude that he is a true representative of the
great world and of the age in which he lives. Loving and true to his
immediate surroundings, he does not localize himself in them, nor does
he shut his thought within his personal feelings and experiences, but he
travels far and wide with the thought and action of the universal man
and fills his life with the life of his age.</p>

<p>It is exactly this universalism that makes <i>The Twelve Words of the
Gypsy</i> his best expression and at the same time the most difficult to
understand thoroughly. The poem is reflective both of the growth of the
poet himself and of the development of the human spirit throughout the
ages with the history and land of Hellas as its natural background.
Consequently, its message is both subjective and objective. Although
differently treated, the theme is the same as that of the "Ascrean"
which appears in the latter part of <i>Life Immovable</i> and which may be
considered as a prelude to <i>The Twelve Words of the Gypsy</i>. There is a
flood of feeling and a cosmic imagery throughout, but they only form the
gorgeous palace within which Thought dwells in full magnificence and
mystic dimness. "As the thread of my song," says the poet in his
preface, "unrolled itself, I saw that my heart was full of mind, that
its pulses were of thought, that my feeling had something musical and
difficult to measure, and that I accepted the rapture of contemplation
just as a lad accepts his sweetheart's kiss. And then I saw that I am
the poet, surely a poet among many&mdash;a mere soldier of the verse, but
always the poet who desires to close within his verse the longings and
questions of the universal man and the cares and fanaticism of the
citizen. I may not be a worthy citizen. <i>But it cannot be that I am the
poet of myself alone; I am the poet of my age and of my race; and what I
hold within me cannot be divided from the world without.</i>"</p>

    <p><i>In Palamas, we have found every trait of the Greek character:
    He is religious and superstitious; a skeptic, a pagan, and a
    pantheist.... He is a poet and a philosopher.... He abandons
    himself to every impulse of the Greek soul. But he is always
    fond of drawing back, of concentrating, of trying to encompass
    in a general form the sensations and ideas which sway him. His
    principal and latent care is to analyze himself and his world.
    A poet and a thinker, Palamas does not attract the multitudes....

</blockquote>

<p>With <i>Life Immovable</i>, the poetic genius of Kostes Palamas reaches its
full strength. The poet, who, from his very first work, <i>The Songs of my
Country</i>, had shown his power in selecting his sources of inspiration
and in weaving the essence of purely national airs into his "light
sketches of sea and olive groves and the various sunlit aspects of Greek
life,"<a href="#footnote_03" class="footnote" id="footnote_ref_03">[3]</a> continues to broaden his vision and art through an
unquenchable eagerness for knowledge, for an understanding of things
beautiful, whether present or past, concrete or abstract. He makes broad
strides from his <i>Hymn to Athena</i>, to <i>The Eyes of My Soul</i>, <i>Iambs and
Anapests</i>, and <i>The Grave</i>. In all "the pathetic and the common meet
inseparably with an art exact and full of grace, an art that knows its
purpose."<a href="#footnote_04" class="footnote" id="footnote_ref_04">[4]</a> But in <i>Life Immovable</i> Palamas rises above the Hellenic
horizon, and strikes the strings of the universal heart in the same
degree as the towns of Patras, Missolonghi, and Athens expand into
Greece and Greece into the world. After all there is both realism and
symbolism in the fact that the first poem of the volume reflects the
atmosphere of the poet's native town while one of the latter ones "The
Ascrean" is filled with an all-including world-vision.</p>

<p>The present volume contains only the first half of <i>Life Immovable</i>. It
consists of five collections of poems: The "Fatherlands," "The Return,"
"Fragments from the Song to the Sun," "Verses of a Familiar Tune," and
"The Palm Tree." On the whole, a careful study of these collections
would furnish the key to an adequate understanding of the rest of the
poet's works for which these poems are faithful preludes. For this
reason I am tempted to give an analysis of the translated parts as a
guide to their understanding. But it is by no means my wish to lay down
a fast rule; poetry is no exact science and there should be always ample
room for freedom of suggestion and of view.</p>


<h3>1. Fatherlands</h3>

<p>A series of sonnets, the "Fatherlands," make the opening of the book
and, at the same time, symbolize most clearly the growth of our poet.
Each sonnet describes a fatherland, adding another link to a chain of
worlds that dawn, one after another, upon the poet's being. The first is
Patras, his birthplace. Then follows Missolonghi with its calm lagoon
and the haunts of his boyhood. The splendor of the violet-crowned city
of Athens is succeeded by the island of Corfu, the cradle of the
literary renaissance of Modern Hellenism, which again fades before the
vision of Egypt, whence the earliest lights of civilization shone upon
the land of the Greeks. Christianity in its extreme form of asceticism
is brought forth from one of its strong citadels, Mt. Athos, the holy
mountain of Greece, and a contrast is made between the "gleaming
beauties of the world" and the utter absorption of the ascetic by the
intangible world beyond. The vision of "Queen Hellas," the classic age
of Greece, is followed by the conquering spirit of Hellenism spreading
triumphantly from the democracies of Athens and Sparta to the Golden
Gate of imperial Byzantium.</p>

<p>But "imagination, like the Phaeacians' ship, rolls on," and the poet
sings:</p>
<blockquote class="quotation">
    <p>In my soul's depths loom many lands ...<br />
    And where the heavens mingle with the sea,<br />
    A path I seek for a sphere beyond ...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oceans are crossed, ages are brought forth from the past, and continents
are joined in making the poet's spirit. Finally even Earth becomes too
narrow and the greater universe opens its gates to the ultimate
fatherland, the elements of the world which will at the end absorb the
being of the poet:</p>

<h3><a id="life_immovable_first_part_the_return">2. The Return</a></h3>

<p>The second collection of <i>Life Immovable</i>, entitled "The Return," is
dedicated to the poet's country. It bears under its title the
significant date of 1897, the year of the unfortunate Greco-Turkish war
which ended disastrously for Greece and plunged the nation into despair.
After the defeat, almost the whole world spoke of the Greeks as of a
degenerate people beyond the hope of redemption. The sensitiveness of
the race helped in rendering the gloom of disaster most depressing. For
some time, even the Greeks began to resign themselves to their fate as a
hopeless one. Palamas is one of the first to sound the reveille. He
conceives of his collection of songs as an expression of faith in the
country's future. With perfect love and assurance "he comes to place the
crowns of Art" "dream-made and dream-engraved" upon her shattered
throne....</p>
<blockquote class="quotation">
    <p>Only with harmony sublime and pure,<br />
    Which, though it rises over time and space,<br />
    Turns the world's ears to his native land,<br />
    The poet is the greatest patriot.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nevertheless even the poet's spirit cannot help reflecting the gloom
through which it tries to rise. The general depression about him weighs
upon him, too, in spite of his effort. This shadow haunts him
constantly. Life becomes a Fairy, with a Fairy's dangerous charms and
fearful mysteries. "Something like a madman pursues life." The poet
hears this madman's falling steps and is horror-haunted:</p>
<blockquote class="quotation">
    <p>And lo, blood of my blood the madman was!<br />
    A past, ancestral, long-forgotten sin,<br />
    That bursting forth upon me, vampire-like,<br />
    Snatched from my hand the dewy crown of joy!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This madman grows from within the individual's and the nation's life.
The wings of joys and dreams are clipped. One feels like a night-owl
upon glorious ruins, the beauty of which makes the night even darker.
Tradition, like a majestic temple, seems to choke life by its solemnity.
The present, which seems to be symbolized by the little hut, is in the
relentless grip of "a monstrous vision, the Fairy Illness, stripped in
the silver glimmer of the moon." There is always the mingling of
gleaming beauty and of bitter sorrow. There is always before us a
"cord-grass festival," the amber fragrant flowers budding upon the
piercing spikes of the cord-grass and luring man to the deadly bog where
there is no redemption. One might say that the poet verges on morbidity.</p>

<p>But such an assumption would be unjust. Palamas may have a clear vision
of the tragedy of life. But in the light of this revelation, with his
unfettered contemplation, he builds, like Bertram Russell, a "shining
citadel in the very centre of the enemy's country, on the very summit of
his highest mountain; from its impregnable watch-towers, his camps and
arsenals, his columns and forts, are all revealed; within its walls, the
free life continues while the legions of Death and Pain and Despair and
all the servile captains of tyrant Fate afford the burghers of that
dauntless city new spectacles of beauty." In like manner, the world of
Greece, in which Palamas lives, "our home," as he calls it, may have its
dreadful silences that are "full of moans," moans vague and muffled as
if coming from a distant world</p>
<blockquote class="quotation">
    <p>Of bygone ages and of times unborn.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But he does not lose sight of that</p>
<blockquote class="quotation">
    <p>Harmony fit for the chosen few, ...<br />
    A lightning sent from Sinai and a gleam<br />
    From great Olympus, like the mingling sounds<br />
    Of David's harp and Pindar's lyre, conversing<br />
    In the star-spangled darkness of the night.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At times the poet even raises his song to rapture. Certainly the past
becomes a source of happiness in his "Rhapsody," and life is agleam with
joy in his "Idyl." But most reflective of this power of the poet to
conquer darkness with light and to turn ruins into gleaming palaces of
beauty and of song, is the poem entitled "At the Windmill."</p>

<p>The local color which is by no means a rare characteristic of the poetry
of Palamas is particularly rich in this collection. Many of its songs
are vivid and clear pictures of Greek life. Yet with the touch of
symbolism, he makes such local flashes world-flames. In "The Dead," we
have a faithful description of the Greek custom of exposing the open
coffin with the body in a room whence all furniture is removed. Friends
and relatives are gathered about the dead; even children are not
excluded from paying this last honor to the departed. The windows are
closed, and in the gloom tapers and candles are burning before the
images of the saints and over the flower-covered body, while the smoke
of the incense and the fragrance of the wreaths fill the air. Yet
somehow in the verses of the song one catches the moving sounds of
mourning humanity, the image of death against life.</p>


<h3>3. Fragments from the Song to the Sun</h3>

<p>"The Fragments from the Song to the Sun" contain some of the noblest
lines of Palamas' poetry. We cannot have a complete understanding of the
symbolism with which this part of <i>Life Immovable</i> is filled. For, after
all, from the great hymn to the light-god, we have here only fragments.
But these fragments remind one of the gold-stained ruins of the
<i>Akropolis</i> against the bright Attic sky. Throughout, we are aware of a
striking duality. The key to these sunlit melodies is probably found in
the "Giants' Shadows." Among the shadows whose voices ascend from
darkness "like moanings of the sea," the poet discovers Telamonian Ajax,
the giant who is utterly absorbed in the world within him, the source of
his light and life, and Goethe, the Teutonic poet, who turns to the
world about himself as a flower to the sun, and whose heart "longs and
thirsts for light." Here then, we detect the doubleness of the sun of
Palamas, a sun within, the source of his inner life and thought, and a
sun without, the source of all external beauty and growth.</p>

<p>Thus without detracting from the charm and power of the day-star, he
ensouls it with a higher meaning and transforms a fiery globe into a
light-clad Olympian divinity, a giver of life and death, a healer and a
slayer. In "The Tower of the Sun," we find mighty princes, sons of
kings, who had gone thither in their desire to hunt for the light,
turned into stones by the "giant merciless." Motionless they stand, a
world of voiceless statues while</p>
<blockquote class="quotation">
    <p>From their deep and smothered eyes,<br />
    Something like living glance<br />
    Struggles to peep through its stone-veil!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then the fair redeemer, a princess beautiful, comes from far away&mdash;the
light, it seems, of inner knowledge and inspiration&mdash;and the Sun's tower</p>
<blockquote class="quotation">
    <p>Gleamed forth as if the light<br />
    Of a new dawn embraced its walls!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She knows where the fountain of life flows and with its waters wakes up
the sons of kings, shining</p>
<blockquote class="quotation">
    <p>... with transcending gleam<br />
    Like a far greater Sun.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is, then, the sun whom Palamas worships as a god. It is a sun who
possesses all the beauty and power of the actual source of light, but
who, at the same time, by the spell of mystic symbolism rises to the
splendor of a thrice-fair and almighty divinity containing all that is
beautiful and noble and powerful in the world. Upon such a sun he seeks
to find a light-flooded palace for his child in the "Mourning Song." To
such a sun he offers his hymns and prayers; and such a sun he conceives
as a vengeful blood-fed Moloch or a muse of light. He is a fair Phoebus,
who rises from pure Olympus' heights to play as a fountain of flowing
harmonies or to smite as "an archer of fiery arrows" all living things.</p>


<h3>4. Verses of a Familiar Tune</h3>

<p>In the "Verses of a Familiar Tune" the poet conceives of himself as of a
wedding guest who travels far away to join the festival. The bride,
"thrice-beautiful" seems to be Earth; and the bridegroom, the Sun. The
journey to the festival is the span of mortal life. The poet, who must
travel over this path, endeavors to brighten it with dreams and shorten
his way's weary length</p>
<blockquote class="quotation">
    <p>With sounds that like sweet longings wake in him<br />
    Old sounds familiar, low whisperings<br />
    Of women's beauties and of home-born shadows ...<br />
    The flames that burn within the heart, the kisses<br />
    That the waves squander on the sandy beach,<br />
    And the sweet birds that sing on children's lips!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The second poem of this group, "The Paralytic on the River's Bank,"
recalls the notes verging on despair which we have found in "The
Return." Again the gleaming past, appearing here as the other bank of
the river, revels</p>
<blockquote class="quotation">
    <p>In lustful growth and endless mirth<br />
    With leafy slopes and forests glistening.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the sight of such splendor, the poet lies palsy-stricken on this bank
of the river, the "graceless, barren, and desert bank" unable to rise
and sing. Then Life, like a merciful Fairy, takes him into the humble
hut of the present and makes him forget the other bank and nourishes him
until, at last, waking into the new world, he weaves the whole day long
with master hand all kinds of laurel crowns and pours into the
unaccustomed air a flute's soft-flown complaint. But again from his bed
he raises his eyes and sees once more the world beyond the river,
nodding luringly at him; and even there, in the midst of the new life,
he falls palsy-stricken, "the paralytic of the river bank."</p>

<p>This note of hopelessness is immediately counteracted by the "Simple
Song," in which Life opens again her gorgeous gardens of the past to
pluck the fairest of flowers; and when he weeps over the newly reaped
blossoms that fill his basket, Life rebukes him by facing them unmoved
"a life agleam!" With like wholesomeness he greets the early dawn that
brings him "thought, light, and sound, his sacred Trinity," and enters
the chapel's garden</p>
<blockquote class="quotation">
    <p>To see the children beautiful,<br />
    Children that make the grassy beds a heaven<br />
    And rise like miracles among the flowers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But on the whole, man, the wedding guest, must travel on while the winds
of uncertainty blow about him. Riddles face him everywhere; questions
stern and unanswerable spring before him; and the life of the whole
human race seems to be that of Thought likened to "an angel ever
wrestling with a strong giant flinging his hundred hands about the
angel's neck to strangle him." For who knows if a good act unknown
shines more than the most splendid monuments of marble or verse? Who
knows if vice is wiser than virtue? Is Fair Art, War's Triumphs, and
great Thoughts expressed costlier in the Temple of the Universe than the
mute Thought and Glory of the flower,</p>
<blockquote class="quotation">
    <p>                        <span class="i8">... at whose birth</span><br />
    The dawn rejoices and whose early death<br />
    The saddened evening silently laments?</p>

    <p>The thoughtful sage high-rising smites the gates<br />
    Of the Infinite and questions every Sphinx;<br />
    Yet who knows if the soldier with no will,<br />
    Obeying blindly, is not nearer Truth?</p>

    <p>O struggle vast! Who knows what power measures<br />
    The measureless and creates the great?<br />
    Is it the matchless thought of the endowed,<br />
    Or the dim soul of the multitude that bursts,<br />
    Thoughtless of reason, into life? Who knows?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We know not "whether the holy man's blessing" is the best, nor whether
there is more light of Truth in the Law, "that is all eyes," or in some
blind love. Thus entangled in the meshes of life's sphinx-like wonders,
we spend our day, little particles of the great world-struggle, wedding
guests at Life's strange festival!</p>


<h3>5. The Palm Tree</h3>

<p>In tenderness and delicacy of thought and expression, no part of <i>Life
Immovable</i> can be compared with the smoothly flowing stanzas of "The
Palm Tree." There is no ruggedness in the meter, no violence in the
stream of images. We are led without knowing it into a modest garden. A
few flowers, a palm tree, some bushes, and the sky make our world, a
world, it seems, of things small and common and trivial. But the poet
passes by, listens to the humble flowers of dark and light blue, and
puts their talk into rhythms.</p>

<p>At once, the flowers become a world of beauty, life, and thought. They
are our kin, sons of the same parent Earth, and dreamers of strangely
similar dreams. The Palm tree over them becomes a great mystery of
power and grace lifting it to the realm of gods. The flowers, like
little mortals, wonder at the things they see about them. Their own
existence beneath the palm tree's shade is full of riddles, and they
face the world with questionings. In the very midst of a clear sky's
festival that succeeds a rain, the little flowers suffer the first blows
of pain, dealt by the last drops that fall from the palm leaves, and
they feel the agony of sorrow until they come to realize that even pain
brings its reward, knowledge, which makes them glory, like victors, over
death. Their being expands and they sing a song which is the essence of
the world's humanity:</p>
<blockquote class="quotation">
    <p>Though small we are, a great world hides in us;<br />
    And in us clouds of care and dales of grief<br />
    You may descry: the sky's tranquility;<br />
    The heaving of the sea about the ships<br />
    At evenings; tears that roll not down the cheeks;<br />
    And something else inexplicable. Oh,<br />
    What prison's kin are we? Who would believe it?<br />
    One, damned and godlike, dwells in us; and she is Thought!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus their song continues carrying them from thought to thought, from
dream to dream, from joy to joy, and from sorrow to sorrow. Swept away
by the charms of life, they raise to their strange god a hymn of
exultation. At the sight of the thrice-fair rose, they sing a song of
love and admiration. Their experiences stimulate their minds, and they
seek to solve the dark problems that teem about them. With the eagerness
of living beings they listen to the tales of new worlds and miracles
brought to them by bees and lizards. Illness and night frighten them
with fearful images; and, at last, they pass away with a song of hope
and regret:</p>
<blockquote class="quotation">
    <p>We shall die,<br />
    Nor will there be a monument for us<br />
    That might retain the phantom of our passing!<br />
    Only about thee will a robe of light<br />
    Adorn thee with a new and deathless gleam:<br />
    And it shall be our thought, and word, and rime!<br />
    And in the eyes of an astonished world,<br />
    Thou wilt appear like a gold-green new star;<br />
    Yet neither thou nor others will know of us!</p>

A Temple waits to clothe thy nakedness divine!"</p>

<p>And with a mouth thrice-wide, and with the voice of prophets,<br />

<p>"Its hour may never come! and if it come, and if<br />

Let pits devour my work! Of all eternal things,<br />

<p>Mother thrice reverend, O widowed saint,<br />
Upon thy shattered throne I come to place<br />
The crowns of Art, dream-made and dream-engraved.<br />
With war storms desolate, my native land,<br />
Trod by the Turk and by strangers scorned thou wert;<br />
Even thy child beholding thee in ruins,<br />
As if the waters of Oblivion<br />
In dark Oblivion's Dale had touched his lips,<br />
Left thee; and thou didst writhe like a whole world<br />
Engulfed in sounds of woe: Hair-tearings and<br />
Breast-beatings, groans of sad despair, night-bats<br />
Wandering restlessly, unheeded prayers<br />
Of souls condemned, loud thunder peals, fierce glares<br />
Of lightnings, and the laughter of the fiends!</p>

<p>But lo, unknown and humble I, with calm<br />
Upon my countenance and storm in mind,<br />
Far from the panic-stricken market place,<br />
Beneath the plane trees' shade, and far away<br />
By the blood-tinctured settings of the suns,<br />
Unruffled, in another land I travelled,<br />
And deep I dug in distant treasure mines.<br />
And with my hand, that knows no rifle's touch,<br />
Slowly I hammered on the crowns of art;<br />
And if thou findest nowhere on their gleam<br />
Thine image painted, or thy blessed name<br />
Written, thou knowest still, O motherland,<br />
Though in thy woe's abyss they seem unlike,<br />
And though a strange and careless glimmer shines<br />
On them, they were created out of thee;<br />
For thee I made them; and for thee I raised them.</p>

<p>Perhaps, when in the midst of wilderness<br />
And ruins thou first openest thine eyes,<br />
O hapless One, my humble offerings<br />
Will not appear like thy wrath's threats, nor like<br />
The joyful trumpetings of thy reveille,<br />
Nor like an image of thy passion's cross,<br />
Nor like thy sorrow's dirge, nor like glad hymns;<br />
But like soft songs and trembling lights and fondlings<br />
Of lily hands, black birds, and stars unknown.</p>

<p>Thus when, smitten with Charon's knife and sunk<br />
In death's dark swoon, a hapless mother feels<br />
Life's tide return, she hears again, like first<br />
Life-summons, the anxious voice of her fond child,<br />
A voice that comforts her and tenderly<br />
Tells of a thousand tales of love his fancy<br />
Weaves or his memory recalls, and drowns<br />
His faintest sigh not to remind his mother<br />
Of the unerring blow of Charon's knife.</p>

<p>Mother thrice-reverend, O widowed saint,<br />
Upon thy shattered throne I come to place<br />
The crowns of Art dream-made and dream-engraved.<br />
Though they will echo not thy sorrow's groans,<br />
A child of thine has bound them on thine earth<br />
With gold; upon their circles thine own speech<br />
Is shown with master tongue; their light is drawn<br />
From thy sun's gleaming fountain; seek no more!</p>

<p>Only with harmony sublime and pure,<br />
Which, though it rises over time and space,<br />
Turns the world's ears to his native land,<br />
The poet is the greatest patriot.</p>

That seems not to exist, yet ever longs<br />
And vainly strives to enter into being.</p>

<p>And now I am Life's widowed mate and hapless,<br />
Life's great and careless patient! Woe is me!<br />
And I am like the fair Alcithoe,<br />
Daughter of the ancient king, who changed her form<br />
And as a sign of the gods' vengeful wrath<br />
Is now instead of princess a night-bat!</p>

<p>See far away, what a glad festival<br />
The golden grasses on the meadow weave!<br />
A festival thrice-fragrant with blond flowers!<br />
With the sweet sunrise sweetly wakening,<br />
I also wish to join the festival<br />
And, like a treasure reaper, to embrace<br />
Masses of flowers blond and fresh with dew,<br />
And then to squander all my flower treasure<br />
At my love's feet, for my heart's ruling queen.</p>

<p>But the gold-spangled meadow spreads too deep;<br />
And, just as mourning for some dead deprives<br />
A life rejoicing with its twenty years<br />
Of its light raiments of a lily-white,<br />
So is my swift and merry way cut short<br />
By a bad way that lies between, without<br />
An end, beset with brambles and with marshes!</p>

<p>The thorny plants tear like an enemy's claws;<br />
And like bird-lime the bad plain's mire ensnares<br />
My feet among the brambles and the marshes,<br />
Where, in the parching sun's enflaming shafts,<br />
The brine, like silver lightning, strikes my eyes!</p>

<p>Where is the coolness of a breath? Where is<br />
The covering shadow of a leafy tree?<br />
I faint! My frame is bent! My way is lost!<br />
I droop exhausted on the briny earth,<br />
And in my lethargy I feel the thorns<br />
Upon my brow; the bitter brine upon<br />
My lips; the sultriness of the south wind<br />
Upon my hands; the kisses of the marsh<br />
Upon my feet; the rushes' fondling on<br />
My breast; and the hard fate and impotence<br />
Of this bare world within me.<br />
                             <span class="i8">Where art thou,</span><br />
My love?<br />

Gorgeously painted, the glad festival<br />
That golden grasses on the meadow weave,<br />
The festival thrice-fragrant with blond flowers,<br />
Sees me, and calls me still, and waits for me!</p>

Nightmares and storms and earthquakes, breaking  nerves.</p>

<p>Delirium flies from her burning lips,<br />
A language made of odd, discordant rhythms.<br />
To nothing, either hers or strange, her eyes<br />
Are like; deep, as abyss untrod, they yawn,<br />
And seem as if they gaze immovable<br />
On empty space. Yet shouldst thou stoop with thirst<br />

The dead man's soul is in this lonely house<br />
Like bitter quiet about a calm-bound ship<br />
That longs for the sea-paths, and dreams of storms.</p>

<p>All faces, smoked with the faint smoke that glides<br />
From candles lighting death! All eyes, still fixed<br />
On a sad coffin! And the mute lips, tinged<br />
With the last kiss's bitterness, still tremble.<br />
As for a prayer, hands are raised, and feet<br />
Move quietly as behind a funeral.<br />
The snow-white nakedness of the cold walls<br />
And black luxuriance of the mourning robes<br />
Are like discordant music of two tunes.</p>

<p>The children's step is light in thoughtful care<br />
Lest they disturb the slumber of the dead.<br />
The old men, bent as at a pit's dark end,<br />
Lean on the virgins' shoulders, virgins fair<br />
Like fates benevolent and comforting.<br />
The young men seek on endless paths to find<br />
In Wisdom's hands the weed Oblivion.<br />
And on the window shutters that are closed,<br />
The clay pots with their flowers seem to be<br />
A dead man's wreath; and the lone ray that glides<br />
Through the small fissure is transformed within<br />
Into a taper's light on All Souls' Day.</p>

<p>The candle burning at the sacred image<br />
Is flickering and snaps as if it wrestled<br />
With death. At moments, led astray, comes here<br />
A butterfly of varied wings and brings<br />
In airy flesh the <i>Ave</i> of the soul<br />
That did enchant the house, the house that seems<br />
Glad for its dead yet loves and longs for him,<br />
The dead blond youth, and claims him as its own!<br />
And luring him, that it might hold for ever<br />
Its chosen love relentlessly, it has<br />
Now changed its form and turned from house to grave!</p>

Worthy of everlasting memory!<br />
Wherever thou still art or wanderest;<br />
Whomever thou hast followed of the two<br />
Women, who, in the past, did stir Alcmena's<br />
Great son, after thou camest upon them<br />
On some crosspath; whether thou blossomest<br />
Like the pure lily, or tower-like thou risest;<br />
Whether thou art neglected like a crumb,<br />
Shinest as thy country's pride, or art alone,<br />
A stranger among strangers wandering;<br />
Whether life's riddle or the grave's holds thee;<br />
Whatever and wherever thou now art,<br />

When in the coldness of a frigid school,<br />
Upon the barrenness of a hard bench,<br />
My teacher's graceless hands placed thee before me,<br />
O peerless book, what I had thought would be<br />
A lesson, proved a mighty miracle!</p>

<p>The heavens opened wide and clear in me;<br />
The sea, a sapphire sown with emerald;<br />
The bench became a throne palatial;<br />
The school, a world; the teacher, a great bard!</p>

<p>It was not reading nor the fruit of thought:<br />
A vision it was that shone most wonderful,<br />
A melody my ears had never heard.</p>

<p>In the great cavern that a forest deep<br />
Of poplars and of cypresses encircles,<br />
In the great fragrant cavern that the glow<br />
Of burning cedar beats with pleasant warmth,<br />
Calypso of the shining hair spins not<br />
Her web with golden shuttle; nor sings she<br />
With limpid voice. But lifting up her hands,<br />
She pours her curses from her flaming heart<br />
Against the jealous gods:<br />

Adored by the immortal goddesses,<br />

It burns the clusters on the fruitful vines!</p>

<p>The hero far renowned of Ithaca<br />
Alone heeds not the flaming curse, that he,<br />
A wanderer, in the Nymph's heart did light<br />
Unwittingly. But sea-wrecked and sea-beaten,<br />
He sits without, immovable, with eyes<br />
Fixed far away; and thus remembering<br />
His native island's shores, for ever weeps<br />
Upon the coast and near the sea thrice-deep.<br />
The white sea-gull that often in its flight<br />
Plunges its wings into the brine to catch<br />
The fish, and the lone falcon perched afar<br />
In the deep forest, lonely and remote,<br />
Listen and answer to the hero's wail.</p>

<p>Oh, for my phantasy's revealed first vision!<br />
Oh, for the baring of the beautiful<br />
Before me! Lo, the dusty, dark-brown land<br />
Changes into a Nymph's isle lily-white!<br />
The humble fisher lass upon the rock,<br />
Into Calypso of the shining hair, love-born!<br />
My heart, a traveller into a thousand<br />
Lands, thirsting for one country, which is love!</p>

<p>And lo, my soul is, ever since, a lyre<br />
Of double strings that echoes with its sound<br />
The harmony thrice ancient, curse or wail!<br />
Joy of all time and glory, godlike Homer!</p>

Making the pier a sea, the street a strand,<br />
And the boat casts anchor at my threshold;<br />
Now when I see, wherever I may glance,<br />
The water's victory, the billow's glory,<br />
And see the rising tide a ruling empress;<br />
Now when a playful and good-minded flood<br />
Closes about the houses, plants, and men<br />
Fondly, in a soft-flowing, sweet embrace;<br />
Now when the air, the planter of the tree<br />
Of Health, raised by the great sea's breath, digs deep<br />
Into the open breasts of living things;</p>

<p>Now, I remember her, the little lass<br />
Who had the sea's pure dew, and, like a wave<br />
Resistless, surpassed the tide in vehemence.<br />
Now I recall the little nimble lass,<br />
Life's victory, blossoming youth's proud glory,<br />
And joy's own throne. Now I remember her.</p>

<p>Her face was like a cloudless early dawn;<br />
Her hair like moonlight shimmering upon<br />
The restless wave; her passing, like the flash<br />
Of a swift fish that in the night swims by<br />
Upon its silver path; her eyes were tinged<br />
With the deep color of the sea beneath<br />
Black clouds; her voice, the sound of a calm night<br />
Upon the beach; her chiseled dimples twin<br />
Upon her cheeks were overfilled with smiles<br />
That Loves might drink from them to slake their thirst.</p>

<p>Boy-like, she stepped on nimble foot and free,<br />
Boldly and daringly with fearless look,<br />
A child's soul dwelling in a woman's flesh.</p>

<p>And when the high tide covered all the land,<br />
Making the pier a sea, the street a strand,<br />
And when the boat cast anchor at my threshold,<br />
Then from her home the little girl came forth<br />
Half bare, half clad, robed in the robe of light<br />
In a swift dancing flood that revelled full<br />
Of water-lust and crowns of seething foam.</p>

<p>She gave her orders to the sea; she ruled<br />
The tide and forward drove the foaming waves,<br />
Just as a shepherd lass, her white-clad sheep.<br />
Her native country, first and last, the sea!<br />
And whenever she passed, a Venus new<br />
Seemed rising from the shining water's depths.</p>

<p>The fisherman, a primitive world's breed,<br />
The sum of Christian and of Satyr blood,<br />
Returning from his fruitful fishing path,<br />
Looked upon her as on an evil tempter<br />
And on a sacred image; and his oars<br />
Hung on his hands inert as palsy stricken,<br />
And the swift-winging bark stood like a rock;<br />
And, marble-like, the fisherman within<br />
Gazed with religious trembling and desire,<br />
Exclaiming as in trance: "O holy Virgin!"</p>

The selfsame lyre with a new quill and breathed<br />
Upon its strings a new heroic breath.</p>

<p>Upon the love-adorned and verdant island,<br />
Like a god's trident, now Alcaeus' quill<br />
Wakens the storm of sounds, and angrily<br />
He strikes with words that are like poisoned arrows<br />
Direct and merciless against his foe,<br />
Whether a Pittacus or Myrsilus.</p>

<p>In vain did tender love reveal before me<br />
On rose-beds Lycus, the young lad, with eyes<br />
And hair coal-black, with rosy garlands bound,<br />
And Sappho of the honeyed smile, the pure,<br />
A muse among the muses, and the mother<br />
Of a strange modesty. Love moved me not!</p>

<p>I raised an altar to the war-god Ares;<br />
And on my walls, I hung war ornaments,<br />
Weapons exulting in the battle's roar.<br />
I sang of the sword bound with ivory,<br />
My brother's spoil from distant Babylon.<br />
I saw my hapless country's ship tossed here<br />
And there, and beaten by the giant waves<br />
Of anarchy; and with my golden Lyre,<br />
Whose voice is mightier than the wild fury<br />
Of a tempestuous sea, I called on War,<br />
The War who revels in men's blood, to come<br />
As a destroyer or deliverer.</p>

<p>And when the war did come in savage din,<br />
Brought upon Lesbos by the might of Athens,<br />
With heart exultant, I saluted him:<br />
"Hail, war of glory!"<br />
                    <span class="i8">Yet, alas and thrice</span><br />
Alas! Amidst the world of death and ruins,<br />
Though eager warrior and heavy armed,<br />
I felt the solid earth beneath me shake;<br />
My vengefulness, fade into fleeting mist;<br />
My breastplate, press on me like a nightmare;<br />
And my white-crested helmet, like a tombstone!</p>

<p>Confusion was my harbor; and I felt<br />
In me Life's longing win the victory.<br />
And while the nations twain, like maddened bulls<br />
Goad-driven, rushed upon each other's death,<br />
And stern Alecto spread about the flames<br />
Of Tartarus, I saw before mine eyes<br />
&mdash;O sight enchanting!&mdash;Lesbos' luring shores!</p>

<p>Never before were they so beautiful<br />
With love and verdant! There I gazed on Lycus,<br />
The boy with eyes and hair coal-black that never<br />
Before had touched my heart so powerfully.<br />
And the Muse Sappho of the honeyed smile<br />
Glittered before me, pure and violet crowned;<br />
And her strange modesty bewitched my tongue<br />
With power unwonted until then; and I,<br />
The strong, silently feasted on her beauty!</p>

<p>And while about the maddened Ares raged,<br />
Reaper of men and vanquisher of rocks,<br />
With my soul's eyes, I followed on the trail<br />
Of the Lyre-God, who passed that way, returning<br />
From the Hyperboreans' land. He passed<br />
Aloft, crowned with a golden diadem,<br />
Upon a chariot drawn by snow-white swans,<br />
Towards his Delphic palaces, flower-decked,<br />
With nightingales and April on his train.</p>

<p>Oh, would that I might live to touch them! Would<br />
That I might hold their charms in my embrace,<br />
Those charms so sweet and guileful and divine!</p>

<p>And at the thought&mdash;alas, and thrice alas!&mdash;<br />
I threw my trusted sword and shield away,<br />
And fled, a shameful coward and a traitor!</p>

Towards the fountain tower-guarded where<br />
Life's water flows. And lo,<br />

<p>Upon the graceless river bank that spread<br />
Barren and desert, all things drooped in sickness;<br />
And I, with palsy stricken, lay in pains!<br />
Vainly my hands shook feather-like with fever;<br />
Methought my feet were nailed upon the ground;<br />
The river, wide and wild; and far beyond,<br />
As far as eyes could see, the other bank<br />
Revelled in lusty growth and endless mirth<br />
With leafy slopes and forests glistening!<br />
Meadows unreaped and glades untrod were there,<br />
And floods of green and tempests of new blossoms!<br />
About the tree-tops glittered crowns of light;<br />
Shadows thrice-deep hid mysteries divine;<br />
And all descended blindly to the bank<br />
Where the wild river's anger held them back,<br />
Seeking, it seemed, a ford to come across<br />
To the dark bank of wilderness and torture!</p>

<p>And toward me all seemed to stretch their hands,<br />
Sending me shameless kisses as I lay<br />
Parched by the burning wind and worn with fever.<br />
Nearby a sun-dried reed poured forth its sighs;<br />
And farther, a small laurel stirred its leaves:<br />
The double treasure of my wilderness.</p>

<p>I wished to cut a flute from the dry reed<br />
And wished a crown of laurel; but I lay<br />
Nailed down immovable as if the rod<br />
Of an enchantress evil-born had touched me;<br />
And within me, with wings of impotence,<br />
My wounded mind fluttered on hopelessly!</p>

<p>And then thou camest girt with working garb;<br />
With girdle flower-spun, with apron full<br />
Of fruits, didst thou bend over me. The spell<br />
Thou didst dispel and gavest me to eat<br />
And cleansedst me with myrrh; and suddenly,<br />
A soul divine and merciful came down<br />
On the bank merciless; and in thine arms<br />
Lifting me gently, thou didst go forth<br />
Amidst a moaning as of humming bees.<br />
Thou stoodst on the threshold of the peasant hut,<br />
The hut that was earth-built and filled with grass<br />
As if the art of a small bird had wrought it.</p>

<p>Thou didst lay me upon a bed at dusk<br />
That I might rest; and mingled with sweet care<br />
And innocence, thou didst lean by my side<br />
With body ripe and beautiful. Wert thou<br />
A lover, mother, sister, or a woman?<br />
Thou didst lay on my brow thy hand to lull me;<br />
And in thy thoughtful face, I saw the gleam<br />
Of kindly Nausica and good Rebecca.</p>

<p>I slept and woke; even my sorrow's ogress<br />
Had turned into a fairy sweetly sad!<br />
And in my hands I found both, laurel bough<br />
And reed! I drank the fragrant morning breath<br />
Of pines; and taking up the laurel boughs,<br />
I wove with master hand the whole day long<br />
All kinds of laurel crowns for thee; and then<br />
I poured into the unaccustomed air<br />
Of thy small hut a flute's soft-flown complaint.</p>

<p>But from my bed, I lifted up mine eyes<br />
To the window's light and saw again, alas,<br />
The desert river bank, and, far beyond,<br />
The world that squandered diamonds and pearls<br />
And revelled in its joy of green dew-clad.<br />
Again they nodded secretly at me,<br />
Stretching their hands and feigning love!<br />
And even near thee, palsy struck I was,<br />
The paralytic on the river bank!</p>

And leading me to sit by ferns dew-clad<br />
And deep green grass and snow-white flowers, thou<br />
Badest me stoop and gather; and I stooped<br />
And gathered all my hands could reach: wall-flowers,<br />
Hyacinths, violets, and daffodils;<br />
And found beside them a May day anew.</p>

<p>Over their petals newly reaped and fresh<br />
That made the basket seem a cruel spring,<br />
I bent and wept for their deaths swift and fair;<br />
And lo, thou didst face them, a Life agleam!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A Dream flew down and stood before mine eyes&mdash;<br />
Who knows from what unknown deep-hidden nest?<br />
It took the face of my own secret love<br />
And blew me with its hands three airy kisses:</p>

<p>The first air-kiss spread in my breast the din<br />
Of bitter and sweet life in waves of air;<br />
And the world's music sounded manifold,<br />
A tempest's roar and a sweet breath's caress.</p>

<p>The second air-kiss whispered low to me<br />
All whisperings that Silence stoops to sing<br />
Over bare wilderness and tombs and ruins,<br />
Songs that no soul nor even wind can hear.</p>

<p>The third air-kiss would bring to me, it seemed,<br />
Secrets from somewhere heard by none before.<br />
Perhaps, by some bright star, two spirits white<br />
Embraced each other as they passed in thought.</p>

Among the mystic joys of things unseen<br />
And things intangible to be herself<br />
Something new, something beyond compare or word.</p>

And scentless, wrapped in thought: by them, I stopped.</p>

<p>Sweet child, upon thy tomb, a rosebud blossomed;<br />
The hand would reach at it, but it cannot.<br />

And suddenly, I mingle speech with rime,<br />
The rime that above human things and woes,<br />

Maternal Rhea treasures in her breast<br />

Snake-like, and Cyclads fair, and Attica.<br />

<p>Upon my passing, slow or swift, by you<br />
I lingered not, nor stooped to pluck you, flowers!<br />
I saw you as a vision skyward roaming,<br />
And I adored you just as thought and sky!<br />
My hand reached not to touch you sinfully,<br />
My flowers! For what is most beautiful<br />
Is also most remote. You were for me<br />
The music that the wind brings on its wings<br />
In perfect strains directly to the heart.<br />
I wished your dazzling could remain as that<br />
Of castles barred and inaccessible.<br />
From far thy fragrance came to me, O jasmine;<br />
And thy gleam, lily, like the eyes' light-kisses!</p>

<p>But since my darling child lay down to sleep<br />
The bitter sleep that knows no wakening,<br />
I am the cruel reaper always bending<br />
Above you, gathering you one by one,<br />
And ever binding you in royal garlands,<br />
And ever weaving you into rich robes<br />
For him! I wish to play new plays with him,<br />
And spread you over him as mine embrace!<br />
I wish to raise him as a flower garden<br />
Breathing into his grave the flower soul<br />
Of an immortal April. Oh, I wish ...<br />
Weak though I am, would all earth's verdancy<br />
Were a long dream and kiss for my beloved!<br />
Would that whatever is beyond man's touch,<br />
Air-born, transcending earth, or fleeting, all<br />
That has a sunbeam as its heart, a breeze as body,<br />
Fair vision, thought, or heaven&mdash;would that I<br />
Could close them into forms and scatter them<br />
Upon his flower-clad grave with you, sweet flowers!</p>

<p>In my paternal love, pure white, the flames<br />
Of passion burn; and then, the yellow languor<br />
Of a sick man! Thus did I love him, flowers!<br />
His father though they called me, I was his lover!</p>

<p>O flowers, did you know it? Was your life,<br />
So pure and little, ever touched by such<br />
A woe? Does not a quenchless longing stir you<br />
As you grow on the selfsame flower bough?</p>

<p>The body of my child, sent up from depths<br />
Unfathomed of a secret Fate unhoped,<br />
Was an epiphany of the fair bride,<br />
The bride undreamable, intangible<br />
Of a god's dream! Was he of mine own blood?<br />
I never thought whether he was to live,<br />
Grow, or advance in thought and deed; I was<br />
Drunk with his luring wine, his eyes, his face,<br />
His gait! The breath of blest Makaria<br />
Had blown on him! The stranger's song revolved<br />
Before my mind: "Thou little line so fine,<br />
Written with roses, line that wert his mouth,<br />
How dost thou give birth to that mighty trembling?"<a href="#footnote_22" class="footnote" id="footnote_ref_22">[22]</a></p>

<p>How often when he turned away his lips<br />
So beautiful in careless weariness<br />
From mine embrace, I felt the torturings<br />
Of a disease and drank the bitter draughts<br />
Of jealousy! How often, when he lay<br />
Reclining on mine arms and breathing gently,<br />
I thought I held the graspless image of<br />
Beauty light-born, and said: "What is there more<br />
For me to hope?" O flowers, did you know it?<br />
Can you, too, mingle your little hidden hearts<br />
Fed with sweet honey, the pure frankincense<br />
Of a thrice-blue and earth-transcending worship,<br />
With love's uneasy little tremblings?</p>

New-grown for his long journey, even I,<br />
The child unskilled, dream-roaming, stript of will!</p>

<p>Old tunes familiar, waft me upon<br />
Your shining wings for healing or for death<br />
To the cool shadow of the pure-white home<br />
And lay me gently on a loving bosom.</p>

<p><i>Once in a garden about a palm tree's shade, some blue flowers, here
very dark and there very light, talked with each other. A poet who now
is dead, passed by; and he put their talk into these rhythms:</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p>O Palm Tree, someone's hand has cast us here;<br />
Was it the hand led by a cursed Fate,<br />
Or moved by mind of good intent? Who knows?<br />
What impulse seized us from the cave of sleep<br />
Below to bring us to the surface here?<br />
Is it a savior's or destroyer's power<br />
That sets us motionless beneath thy shade?<br />
And is thy shade the shade of life or death?</p>

<p class="thought_break">       *       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>The glare of the hot sun drowned everything;<br />
Gluttonous locusts groped for food about;<br />
And then, a rain. The flowers, that had drooped<br />
To sleep, awake to drink the drops of dew.<br />
And then, the clear sky's festival begins<br />
More azure than before to spread above thee.</p>

<p>Only thy trembling crest drops here and there<br />
Some large and shining rain-pearls on the earth.</p>

<p class="thought_break">       *       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>The garden glitters with a new-born life;<br />
And each bird dreams it is a nightingale;<br />
Only from thy lone heights like bullets fall<br />
Thy pearl-clear drops, and oh, the pain thereof!<br />
The dew drops make a crown for everything;<br />
The gurgling waters are a balm to all;<br />
Why should this god-sent goodness of all things<br />
Be blow for us and suffering and flame?</p>

<p class="thought_break">       *       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>How cruelly thy bullets fall and smite!<br />
No ear above and not an eye before us!<br />
Beneath thy shade we live; thy trunk is world<br />
To us; thy crown, a star-spun sky, our sky!<br />
If thou art a god merciless, reveal<br />
Thyself! If not, but nod and give us calm!<br />
Either cease slaying us one by one, or pour<br />
On us at once a flood to drown us all!</p>

<p>Our pain is as reward and treasure found!<br />
The golden seal of harmony has stamped us,<br />
And while Death touches us, we glory, victors!<br />
We tremble; hail O rhythm's thrice-sacred tremor!<br />
A worm may live sunless beneath the earth<br />
That a new butterfly of silken wings<br />
May live an hour of perfect life and die.<br />
The wound's gash turns into a living fountain!</p>

<p class="thought_break">       *       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>Things gray, things crystal, myriad hues of green,<br />
Gushings of fountains clear, and caterpillars,<br />
Earth's things immovable, air-sailing ships,<br />
And little worms, and bees, and butterflies,<br />
Sweet flower-grails and censers, fondling grass,<br />
The moss-down's countless kisses, echoes from<br />
Below, and mandolins ethereal,<br />
Leaves quivering and lilies languor-bringing!</p>

<p class="thought_break">       *       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>The turtle-doves know not what you know, blossoms,<br />
The chosen things of beautiful loves, you!<br />
Kisses and starts and wooings of the boughs!<br />
The birth of each of you is a world's dawn!<br />
You know, O little tearful short-lived things,<br />
You know pleasure's and joy's eternities!<br />
We, the gold garlands wreathed about thy root,<br />
Are like celestial and thoughtful eyes!</p>

<p class="thought_break">       *       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>Blithe flowers, boughs that hang with blossoms full,<br />
From dandelions to the chamaemele,<br />
You may be like the glowing coals or gems,<br />
Or like a maiden's rosy cheeks and lips.<br />
Though you, like hands, may open full or empty,<br />
And though you be dawn's smiles or evening's candles,<br />
Or the fair palaces of Fairy Dew,<br />
The gazing eyes are we! We are the eyes!</p>

<p class="thought_break">       *       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>Though small we are, a great world hides in us;<br />
And in us clouds of care and dales of grief<br />
You may descry; the sky's tranquility;<br />
The heaving of the sea about the ships<br />
At evenings; tears that roll not down the cheeks;<br />
And something else inexplicable. Oh,<br />
What prison's kin are we? Who would believe it?<br />
One, damnèd, and godlike, dwells in us; and she is Thought!</p>

<p class="thought_break">       *       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>Frolick, and form, and wanton playfulness,<br />
And some unspoken radiant vanity,<br />
And some enrapturing bewitching charm,<br />
And perfect virgin beauty are your own!<br />
Fading like gods' pale images, you seem!<br />
Even the bird sometimes bows to your grace!<br />
And Nereids wind-footed fan your faces,<br />
O roses with a thousand smiles divine!</p>

<p class="thought_break">       *       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>A god commanded it, the flower-haired April!<br />
"O flowing fragrance, change to brilliancy!"<br />
Thus you are scentless, roses of Bengal;<br />
All others' perfume is bright light in you.<br />
And thou, O lily, king among the flowers,<br />
From what far world hast thou been led astray?<br />
Was it from fragrance's own womb, or from<br />
The whitest star? And we, O Palm? Who knows!</p>

<p>River ethereal of fragrance, stay!<br />
Thou hast not flowed nor watered us at birth.<br />
We said to fragrance: "Cease thy flowing course;<br />
Well not from us; nor be our breath! Sink deep<br />
Into our heart's recesses; close thyself<br />
Regardless of thy perfume in our soul!<br />
Then seek to find our thought and live with it<br />
And flow from it as honey from the bee!"</p>

<p class="thought_break">       *       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>"Bring forth from the rich treasures of the sun<br />
All colors, flowers, and deck yourselves with them!"<br />
We said unto our little brothers: "Make<br />
Robes of the heaven's rainbow for your raiment!"<br />
And to ourselves we said: "Soul, I<br />
Shall let aside all brilliance! I need not<br />
Sunset or dawn; enough would be something<br />
Of the great sea and of the heaven's smile!"</p>

<p class="thought_break">       *       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>Become a cloud, O great Desire, and speak<br />
With lightnings and with thunders! Rise, a lark,<br />
And sing and soar towards a new starry garden!<br />
Turn all thy flooding music into love,<br />
Mingle with it all children's innocence<br />
And all the beauty that is thine; still thou<br />
Wilt have love's shadow only but not love.<br />
For love shines, burns, illumines quenchlessly!</p>

<p class="thought_break">       *       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>The garden draws life from a triple soul,<br />
A soul that spreads creeping upon the earth<br />
With roots beneath and wings above. A city,<br />
The caterpillar builds in its great depths;<br />
The bird builds love towards heights ethereal!<br />
About all green things live to be thy slaves<br />
And trimming ornaments, O palm! How high<br />
Skyward thou raisest thy grace-moulded body!</p>

<p class="thought_break">       *       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>No ivy limits and no offshoot mars<br />
Thy trunk's unchained and chiseled nakedness;<br />
And yet, though naked, with a charm dream-wrought<br />
Thou coverest the alleys of the garden.<br />
And as an emblem of thy reign, a crown<br />
Of beams pearl-born and silver-born shines bright<br />
As it hangs trembling from thy top, O palm.<br />
Oh what a rhythm governs thy form divine!</p>

<p class="thought_break">       *       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>So beautiful is not the cypress young<br />
As it waves towards the sky, moved by the breeze!<br />
So beautiful is not the mossy fountain<br />
That sings like bard and nourishes like mother!<br />
So beautiful is not sunrise or sunset!<br />
Another world's day hangs from thy high crest!<br />
So beautiful is not the tranquil lake!<br />
Gods and their hymns god-sung are at thy feet!</p>

<p class="thought_break">       *       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>Neither an angel's shade in a hermit's cave,<br />
Nor harmony's voice in Night's deep silence,<br />
Nor the great maker's thought just as it dawns<br />
In his wide-fronted heaven, and is still<br />
A maiden dream unyoked before it finds<br />
A dwelling in the form of word or music,<br />
Color or marble! None of these is like<br />
Thine image caught and mirrored in our thought!</p>

<p>Is it transparent and immortal blood<br />
That flows in thee, or sap too weak to wake thee<br />
From thy long spell of blind and voiceless sleep<br />
Into a crystal life's fair revelry?<br />
Is thy head's crown another's counterfeit,<br />
Or thine own locks that smitten by the wind<br />
Become stringed lyres to sing in murmurs sweet<br />
Of the world's symphony and of thy beauty?</p>

<p class="thought_break">       *       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>Neither thy boughs nor locks they are, but wings<br />
That thou wouldst ply with gentle flutterings!<br />
Wings? They are not, though they become; and ever<br />
A hunger tortures thee, and ever thou<br />
Strugglest to enter a sublimer world!<br />
Right, left, high, far, thou seekest a fair city,<br />
Some sunlit Athens, and standest bent on flying<br />
With swans and cranes towards the azure heavens.</p>

<p class="thought_break">       *       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>Art thou a relic of a dead age and great,<br />
Or the first dew of a becoming life?<br />
Now some Wood Nymph bound within thee peeps out<br />
Struggling to flow into the light about;<br />
And now thou risest like the column last<br />
Of an old temple that once stood in Hellas.<br />
Evening or morning, end or a beginning,<br />
Something binds thee to skies beyond all sight.</p>

<p class="thought_break">       *       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>Hosannas from thy boughs and palm leaves flow,<br />
Hosannas from thy royal height, as prayer<br />
To some unknown god's charms, who passes by<br />
Revealing his fair godhead first to thee.<br />
And lo, the hillsides answer thine hosannas!<br />
Oh, what thy visions, what thy secrets are?<br />
Some tremor, from new heavens wafted, makes<br />
The supple flowers and green leaves quiver.</p>

<p class="thought_break">       *       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>And we? The migrant bird did come to us;<br />
The passing wind did touch us with its wing;<br />
The restless brook did check its rapid course;<br />
The child did cast on us his guileless glance;<br />
The jonquil proud did greet us with a nod;<br />
And the moon did look down to see us here;<br />
And all beheld our surface; none our depths!<br />
Thus the world glided over us and vanished!</p>

<p class="thought_break">       *       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>Sweet orange blossoms, what asked the nightingales?<br />
What would the dry cicala know of noontide?<br />
All things that groan from the great depths of earth,<br />
All songs that mount exultant to the stars,<br />
The eating moth's faint voice, the restless cricket's,<br />
Perfumes and breezes, creatures lone and mated,<br />
All things that fly and creep and bend and stoop,<br />
Something they know of thee and hide it from us.</p>

<p class="thought_break">       *       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>Within our breasts, a soul of storm and pitch<br />
Puts into our minds evil thoughts of thee.<br />
The magpie chatters long to the night bat<br />
Of thee; the locust boasts she is like thee;<br />
The wasp draws ample pleasure in thy shelter;<br />
And the night raven finds delight in thee.<br />
A world of evil and of scorn lies wait<br />
For thee who mountest tranquil to the stars.</p>

<p>O Health blown from the heart of the pure pine!<br />
Where thy feet tread, fruits grow 'midst thorns and clover;<br />
If with the streams thou flowest, the elements<br />
Shine; for pure wine, thou reapest the fair clusters;<br />
And where thou lingerest, a city rises!<br />
Thy breasts flow ever with milk; thy lips with dew!<br />
O mother fruitful, strong, and whole, some ill<br />
Rots us and we are pale like death's faint tapers!</p>

<p class="thought_break">       *       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>Boughs, tresses, wings; shadows whose grace divine<br />
Frolics and spreads as bough or tress or wing;<br />
Another night, you took another form<br />
In the enchanted pitiless moonlight,<br />
A form that was neither bough, tress, nor wing:<br />
Swords you seemed, ready to descend and smite!<br />
Night's roaming butterfly, be merciful!<br />
Lift us upon thy wings and fly away!</p>

<p class="thought_break">       *       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>Illness and wakefulness have tortured us,<br />
O palm, and we saw thee bend secretly!<br />
The dragon's heads and dogwoods were awake;<br />
We saw thee leading a strange dance with them<br />
At night; and in our first sleep, we beheld thee<br />
A heavy dream roaming with mulleins and<br />
Chameleons; about thee closed whole gardens<br />
Of thistles, aloes hard, and hosts of briars!</p>

<p class="thought_break">       *       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>We dreamed and lo, thou wert demanding tribute<br />
Of life, blood-drenched; and in thy being raged<br />
A savage hunger; and some beast flesh-eating<br />
Nestled in thee and gnawed a hole through thee;<br />
And thy winged body turned into a cave;<br />
A vulture perched as crown upon thy head;<br />
And like fire-flames, and sea-waves, and sword-blades,<br />
From root to top, fierce snakes crept up and coiled!</p>

<p class="thought_break">       *       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>Who ever thought of it? What Fate has ruled<br />
That from ill-smelling things and worthless stuff<br />
Should rise things of resplendent green? and from<br />
Deforming filth, the thrice-pure miracle<br />
Of May and April? Hence things blue and black<br />
Mingle in us; and in our souls, spread oceans<br />
And narrow paths; and while our minds converse<br />
With things sublime, something thrice-base defiles us!</p>

<p class="thought_break">       *       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>O Sun, assail and strangle all black dreams,<br />
Our life's dim vapors and ill-working demons!<br />
But nourish all things good and beautiful<br />
Like sunbeams playing and like nightingales!<br />
And thou, O moon, spread over savage Night<br />
A veil translucent of heart-felt sympathy!<br />
Wave everywhere, O Beauty's purple robe!<br />
Let the great world be love and love's sweet lyre!</p>

<p class="thought_break">       *       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>Day comes! Light scatters a thousand eyes on thee<br />
So that thou mayest greet the woods and mountains,<br />
The nests upon the trees, the palaces<br />
Of cities, and the ships on open seas<br />
Or ports. At nights, mounted on steeds of light<br />
Beautiful Fairies come from high to serve thee;<br />
The poplar lifts its many hands to thee;<br />
And the dark cypresses lull thee to sleep.</p>

<p>With pelicans and eagles thou conversest,<br />
And drop by drop thou drinkest the world's music;<br />
Thou seest things far, things near, and things above;<br />
Things infinite, intangible, and great;<br />
And thou communest with air-sailing ships,<br />
Light-rays, and wings, and the world-mounting ladder;<br />
While we, bent low, and lashed by sorrow's whip,<br />
Listen to the great throbbing of Earth's heart!</p>

<p class="thought_break">       *       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>We heard it, the great throbbing of Earth's heart,<br />
The new song inconceivable, unheard,<br />
Of consummate and perfect sound!<br />
Through it, some thunder-stricken angel groans;<br />
All April's gardens breathe in fragrant balms;<br />
Some unfulfilled and secret longings weep;<br />
And a fire crackles that will ruin worlds!<br />
Something that passes by, an endless riddle!</p>

<p class="thought_break">       *       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>Tell thou the sunlit story of the air;<br />
We shall unroll to you the tale of blackness.<br />
Come, let us mingle the two elements,<br />
Thy mighty power with our own winning grace!<br />
In unseen places, small and cold and sunless,<br />
A world of workers and of corsairs dwell;<br />
And there are paths and deeds of theirs, and days,<br />
And what the infinite air-spheres have not!</p>

<p class="thought_break">       *       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>A swarm of bees has told us of their life,<br />
And a new youth and wise shone unto us!<br />
The grass hides unsuspected miracles;<br />
Beside us, the ant opens a deep path;<br />
A lizard, slowly creeping from below,<br />
Brought us here news of countries, nations, arts;<br />
A butterfly on her swift flight to wed<br />
The little flowers broadened our world of thought!</p>

<p class="thought_break">       *       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>Unwedded, fruitless Palm, fair mystery!<br />
Strange was the hour&mdash;who will believe it now?&mdash;<br />
The divine world willed to become a thought,<br />
And thought revealed itself unto our mind!<br />
Now, unto darkness and to riddles new,<br />
Our little life is ready to depart!<br />
O Palm, make answer; lo, before thou speakest<br />
Thy word sublime, a hand lays wait to smite!</p>

<p class="thought_break">       *       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>O Palm, a hand did spread to sow us here;<br />
That hand will spread again to root us out,<br />
And we shall die! The billow and the wind<br />
And the still waters will sweep us away<br />
Mercilessly! The flowery spring will not<br />
Lament us! The wide world will never know<br />
We perished! And beneath thy shadow's charms,<br />
Another fragrant race will rise to life.</p>

<p class="thought_break">       *       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>Nor will there be a monument for us<br />
That might retain the phantom of our passing!<br />
Only about thee will a robe of light<br />
Adorn thee with a new and deathless gleam:<br />
And it shall be our thought, and word, and rime!<br />
And in the eyes of an astonished world,<br />
Thou wilt appear like a gold-green new star;<br />
Yet neither thou nor others will know of us!</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="footnote_19" href="#footnote_ref_19" class="footnote_label">[19]</a> A pseudonym for Constantine Chatzopoulos, one of the leading
     literary figures in Athens to-day. He has written poems under this
     pseudonym. But he is now mainly known as a master of short stories
     which he has published under his real name, and as the translator
     of Göthe's <i>Faust</i> and of Hofmannsthal's <i>Electra</i>. This poem
     dedicated to him was written during the unfortunate Greco-Turkish
     war of 1897.</p>

     Driscos, November 29, 1912. He is the writer of exquisite sonnets
     and the successful translator of various foreign poems. The
     Cretan Revolution of 1896 is here alluded to, which led to the
     Greco-Turkish war of 1897. Maviles was one of the first to hasten
     to Crete to help in the struggle for liberty.</p>

     contemporary Greece, who, like Psicharis, has lived mostly far from
     Greece. He is a poet, a critic, and a satirist. But his fame is
     mainly due to his translation of the <i>Iliad</i> and that of the <i>New
     Testament</i>. The publication of the latter caused the student riots
     of 1901.</p>
